# Getting Started

The course uses Python with the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) integrated development environment (IDE). In the following we explain how to set-up your development environment, and how to get started with the assignments. The setup and assignments are tested for Windows 10 and the respective versions as mentioned below. Unfortunately we cannot support other versions or operating systems.


_Install Python 3_

For this course we use Python as our programming language. Navigate to `https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/`, and download and install the 64-bit version of Python `3.9.x`. Make sure to install this version, because TensorFlow does not (yet) support later versions of Python. Follow the instructions of the setup process, and make sure to enable the option that adds Python to your `PATH`.


_Install VSCode_

VSCode is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for many programming languages. VSCode incorporates auto-completion, syntax and style-checks, Git integration and many other handy features. Navigate to `https://code.visualstudio.com/`, and install the latest version for Windows. When opening VSCode for the first time, choose "Browse Language Extensions" and install the extensions for Python and Jupyter.


_Install Git Bash for Windows_

Git Bash is a standalone command-line interface for Git. Navigate to `https://git-scm.com/downloads` and install the latest Git Bash for Windows.


_Setup GitHub_

GitHub is an online hosting platform for code-related projects. In this course you will use GitHub to host your work and collaborate with peers on a shared code-base. Assuming you already have a GitHub account, navigate to `https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account` and follow the instructions to setup your SSH keys. Note that this may require you to generate a new SSH key.


_Assignments_

With your environment setup, you can start the assignments. The assignments are divided into three projects, and will be shared via a GitHub Classroom invitation.

1. A Git and Github tutorial, where you'll learn to use basic version control (individually, week 1);
2. The development and training of an application that assists realtors in valuating housing prices (individually, week 2,3);
3. The development and training of a pokerbot, an agent that plays Kuhn poker against fellow students (group, week 4-8).
